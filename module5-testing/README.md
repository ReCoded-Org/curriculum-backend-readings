# Module 5: Testing

Last revised: 07/12/2021

## Summary

No company can scale beyond a small project without automated testing. Students will
learn about unit and integration testing, in addition to learning best practices
surrounding writing clean, modular, and hermetic tests. This unit will emphasize not
only writing tests as a means to verify robustness of code, but also utilizing test-writing as a developer mindset for writing safe code.
