# Testing Philosophy
In this section, we'll discuss some aspects of testing philosophy. There are
many different ways to approach testing.

In real life, you may perhaps work at
companies that do almost no testing (this is not good, but it is the reality).
This is especially true in smaller companies. You may work at a company that
chooses only to test certain components or write certain types of tests.
Finally, as mentioned previously, at some companies, especially bigger ones, you
may be required to write tests so that every line of code is covered by a test.

Simply writing a test is not sufficient: there are also good and bad ways to
write tests. In the sections ahead, we'll consider some additional factors about
the testing process and the quality of tests.
