# Testing Libraries in JavaScript
There are a number of testing libraries in JavaScript. The differences between them are not major. Similar to many other things that you
will learn, if you know one of them, you will understand the general concepts of
the others.

Feel free to explore some of the tutorials below.
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)
* [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/#getting-started)
* [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/pages/getting_started.html)
* [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/): focus on end-to-end testing

Again: most of the concepts you will learn are agnostic to the framework being
used. For example, with the properties of good tests that we discussed, it does
not matter if you are using Jest, Mocha, Jasmine, or if you are not even using
JavaScript. Try not to focus too much on learning a specific framework but
instead understanding how it executes the ideas of testing.
