# Summary

You have now learned how to write unit tests and enforce static analysis checks on your backend projects. You have also practiced the testing mindset and approach of test driven development in testing different parts of the backend such as functions, controllers, routes and middleware. A backend developer who also has a strong knowledge of testing can be trusted to write really solid, error-free code that is easy to maintain over the long-term.

So now that we know so much about building backend applications and testing them, we're getting close to learning all about deploying our applications to the production stage. And one important aspect of production ready applications is a solid architecture and design. We'll learn all about this in the next module!
