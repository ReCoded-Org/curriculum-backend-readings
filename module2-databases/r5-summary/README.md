# Summary

Congratulations! You've completed the Module 2 of this course, that is 25% of the curriculum. You have learned about the different types of databases - relational and non-relational. You have explored MySQL, MongoDB and Elasticsearch and got familiar with many other databases.

Think about some applications that you like to use, and ponder what types of databases they may be using. What tables might they have? What might those columns look like?

In the next module, we will put our APIs and database together such that each API endpoint performs a CRUD operation on a persistent database.
