## Introduction to Databases

In this module, you'll learn about **databases**. Database is a general term
that refers to the data stored in a structured format. We use databases when we
want to persist data for future use. For example, in a web application, when a
user writes something in a text box, this data will be lost when the page is
refreshed -- unless this data is persisted in a database.

Databases are a ubiquitous and foundational part of backend technology. One
would use databases instead of local storage or cookies, for example, when the
information being persisted needs to be available to any possible client. For
example, information stored in [local
storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) is not automatically synchronized
across browsers. For example, if you were to store information about user
settings in local storage, then those settings would no longer be available on a
different browser -- but if you store them in a database, the user can access
them from any client.
