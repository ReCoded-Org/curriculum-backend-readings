## Introduction to Databases

In this module, you'll learn about **databases**. Database is a general term
that refers to the data stored in a structured format. We use databases when we
want to persist data for future use. For example, in a web application, when a
user writes something in a text box, this data will be lost when the page is
refreshed -- unless this data is persisted in a database.

Databases are a ubiquitous and foundational part of backend technology.
