# Module 2: Databases

### SQL queries practice
Now try to run some SQL queries against the tables that you created:
* Create at least two new customers
* Create at least three orders for each customer
* Select the last names of all customers
* Select the users, sorted by oldest first (hint: use Google)
* Use the `LIMIT` keyword to select only one order
* *Optional:* write a query that returns two columns: the ID of each user and
    the number of orders for that user. Hint: you need join, use `GROUP BY`, and
    use `COUNT(*)`. Use Google to read about these.

### MongoDB queries practice
* Create two collections, `customer` and `order`
* Try to insert similar data as you did in the MySQL database, but this time in
    a NoSQL database
* Try to do the same queries as the previous exercise, but in MongoDB (either
    through the command-line or JavaScript)
