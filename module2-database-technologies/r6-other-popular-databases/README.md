# Other popular databases

## Elasticsearch
[Elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch) is a database that
specializes in the search of text. While relational databases focus on a tabular
format, Elasticsearch can efficiently search through large text files, such as
application logs.

## neo4j
[neo4j](https://neo4j.com) is a [graph
database](https://aws.amazon.com/nosql/graph/). These databases are optimized
for data that can be represented easily by a [graph](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~sheard/course/Cs163/Doc/Graphs.html), a type of data structure
common in programming. Graphs are generally used to represent the relationships
between entities of the same type, such as in a social network (relationships between friends) or
recommendation engines (relationships between movies).
