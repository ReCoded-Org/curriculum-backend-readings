# Summary

We hope you enjoyed learning TypeScript with us and now when you see a codebase full of `.ts` files you will not feel confused. You can also market yourself as a junior developer familiar with TypeScript which would be very valuable for companies looking to hire.

To further enhance your learning, you can explore GitHub for open source TypeScript projects so that you can skim through a rich codebase and look at Types in action. Sometimes for small projects and assignments as a beginner it may feel like TypeScript is too overwhelming or completely unnecessary. To see it in a larger and more complex codebase puts things into perspective. And not only TypeScript, but for any new concept that you learn you can always search for open source repositories and use them as a learning resource. There is a lot to learn from the open source community. And continuous learning helps keep the mind flexible and not get too attached to a single language or framework.
