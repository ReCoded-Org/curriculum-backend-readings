# Introduction to cloud computing

In the olden days, companies would keep physical computers at their company in order to run a website which is called on-premises datacenter. Or you might have tried hosting your application on a hosting server that gives you a shared or dedicated hosting storage space on Virtual Private Server (VPS) to host your application. The hosting server is usually in charge of handling the infrastructure and the underlying environment like PHP processor, or nodejs.

That was enough at some point in time, but then the needs grew larger when web apps were used more and more, the VPS bandwidth was not enough to accomodate the usage surge. Nor it was enough to fascilitate the communications between many backend applications. Or if the company used their own physical servers, they have to manage everything, such as purchasing and installing hardware, virtualization, installing the operating system, and any other required applications, setting up the network, configuring the firewall, and setting up storage for data. After doing all the set-up, they become responsible for maintaining it through its entire lifecycle.

That was when the cloud infrastructure came alive. Cloud Computing is the delivery of computing services such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, intelligence, and more, over the Cloud (Internet). It provides an alternative to the on-premises datacentre. In Cloud Computing, a cloud vendor is responsible for the hardware purchase and maintenance. They also provide a wide variety of software and platform as a service. We can take any required services on rent. The cloud computing services will be charged based on usage. The cloud environment provides an easily accessible online portal that makes handy for the user to manage the compute, storage, network, and application resources.

## Advantages of cloud computing

- Cost: It reduces the huge capital costs of buying hardware and software.
- Speed: Resources can be accessed in minutes, typically within a few clicks.
- Scalability: We can increase or decrease the requirement of resources according to the business requirements.
- Productivity: While using cloud computing, we put less operational effort. We do not need to apply patching, as well as no need to maintain hardware and software. So, in this way, the IT team can be more productive and focus on achieving business goals.
- Reliability: Backup and recovery of data are less expensive and very fast for business continuity.
- Security: Many cloud vendors offer a broad set of policies, technologies, and controls that strengthen our data security.
