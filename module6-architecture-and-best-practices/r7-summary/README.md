# Summary

And another module ends here. We have learned so much in this one. We started by taking a deep dive into the architecture and design patterns and looked at lots of best practices that help us get our applications ready for production. We learned about a different kind of database called Redis and architectural operations like caching, job queues, and production-level session management. We moved beyond REST and got familiar with the concept of WebSockets, learned about executing repeated operations through cron jobs, and more best practices on logging. Finally, we spent some time on the microservices architecture pattern and learned about building high-performance, reliable and available services.

These were all heavy and advanced topics! So if you're feeling a bit lost in this module, that is completely normal. Do not be hard on yourself to master the entirety of backend and especially advanced architecture topics in a matter of weeks. Understanding is built over a period of time and with lots of practice. Make sure you have learned enough to "just start" putting things into practice, and you can always come back to these readings when you've gotten more practice on backend web development.

With that, let's get ready for the next module where we'll learn all about deploying our applications to the cloud so that they no longer live on just our computers but are available to real users across the world. Cloud Computing is up next!
