# Module 6: Architecture and Best Practices

Last revised: 14/06/2022

## Summary

Students will go through a practical exploration of design patterns such as factory
methods, singleton, state pattern along with architectural choices like websockets and
microservices understanding the advantages and disadvantages of each approach in
writing well-structured, error-free, maintainable code supporting complex features.
Students will also familiarize themselves with the concepts of caching and job
processing that contribute to the performance optimization and reliability of
applications.
