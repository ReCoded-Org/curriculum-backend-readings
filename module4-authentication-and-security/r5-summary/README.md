# Summary

And with that we are halfway through the backend web development curriculum of this bootcamp. Cue the dance music!

We have learned all the fundamental concepts required to develop a backend application. We are now capable to build fully functional REST APIs connected with a database making different CRUD operations. We have also learned to implement authentication and authorization and follow general security best practices.

It is completely normal to feel a little bit overwhelmed at this point of the bootcamp. Afterall you have learned a lot in the last 4 weeks. You can always come back to these lessons to refresh your memory about certain topics. And ultimately it all comes down to practice. The more code you write, the more practice you'll get and slowly you will find all these concepts becoming second nature to you, and you will be able to remember and explain everything related to backend.

Now it's time to start exploring the beyond fundamental concepts. Hope you're as excited as we are!
