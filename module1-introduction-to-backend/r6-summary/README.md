# Summary

Congratulations! You have completed Module 1 of this course. You have learned the fundamentals of backend web development from the HTTP request-response lifecycle to how to build a REST API server with Node.js and Express.js. You built our own API that handles different HTTP requests like GET, PUT, POST and DELETE. You familiarized yourself with API best practices, server-side validation and API documentation.

An API is incomplete without data persistence. So now we move on to the next component of the backend - Databases.
