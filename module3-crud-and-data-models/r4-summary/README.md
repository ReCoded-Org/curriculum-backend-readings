# Summary

It's been 3 weeks together and we have now completed 37.5% of the backend web development curriculum! Math lovers of this bootcamp will definitely appreciate this progression. We learned about creating a good database schema, then dived into CRUD requests with Mongoose and how to create a RESTful API with data persistence. We also touched on project structure using the MVC design pattern, and finally we learned about creating custom methods in Mongoose.

With that being said, now you should be able to build a well-structured backend application with Node, Express and Mongoose! Ensure you have a good schema and add validation to your routes, and you will have a well-performing and reliable API.

But you are still missing one of the big pillars in backend development, and that is **authentication**! We will learn this in the next module.
