## Conclusion

We learned a bit about creating a good database schema, then dived into CRUD requests with mongoose and how to create a RESTful api, we also touched on folder structure using the MVC design pattern, finally, we learned about creating custom methods in mongoose.
With that being said, now you should be able to build a well structured back-end application with NodeJS, express, and mongoose for better MongoDB models.
But you are still missing one of the big pillars in back-end development, and that is **authentication**! Which you are going to learn in the next module.
